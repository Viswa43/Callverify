1. Spam Detection


Problem:
========
	---Users can mistakenly or deliberately mark numbers (even those belonging to friends or relatives) as spam. This misclassification can lead to important contacts being flagged as spam.

Proposed Solution:
==================
Verification of Number Usage:
-------------------------------
	---Check whether the reported number is active or not. This can be done by verifying if the number is currently registered or in use.
Database Lookup:
----------------
	---Check if the number exists in the application database or user records.
Contact Popularity Analysis:
----------------------------
	---Count how many users have saved this number in their contact lists.
	---If a significant number of users have saved this number, it is less likely to be spam.
Final Assessment:
-----------------
	---If no one has saved the number or very few users have it in their contacts, it can be flagged as potential spam.
Key Considerations:
--------------------
	---Utilize crowdsourced data while respecting user privacy.
	---Include an option for users to appeal incorrect spam classifications.
	---Use machine learning models to dynamically update the spam detection logic based on false positive reports.



2. Ambiguity in Name Representation
Problem:
========
	---When multiple users save the same phone number under different names (e.g., "abc12" and "abcbro"), it becomes unclear which name should be displayed when searching for the number.

Proposed Solution
=================
Database Query:
----------------
	---Check if the number exists in the system's database.
Retrieve Associated Names:
--------------------------
	---Fetch all the names under which this number has been saved across users.
Similarity Analysis:
--------------------
	---Use algorithms to identify similar patterns among the saved names (e.g., "abc12" and "abcbro" share "abc").
	---If a common pattern is found, prioritize it.
User-Specific Context:
----------------------
	---Display the name that the current user has saved, if available.
	---If no user-specific name exists, display the most commonly used or popular name.
Key Considerations:
-------------------
	---Allow users to add a "preferred name" for numbers they frequently interact with.
	---Use AI-based clustering techniques for better name similarity detection.
